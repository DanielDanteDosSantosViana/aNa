 * Class that represents a base of imported documents.
 * 
 * <br/>
 * 
 * All bases defined in an imported document, as well as its body are imported.
 * The bases defined in the imported document are treated as if they were imported
 * by a base in the NCL document head. The body of the imported document is treated
 * as a context element.
 * 
 * <br/>
 * 
 * The body of the imported document is not included in the NCL document body. The
 * elements defined in the imported document body just become avaliable to be
 * reused inside the NCL document that imports it.
 * 
 * <br/>
 * 
 * This element defines the attributes:
 * <ul>
 *  <li><i>id</i> - id of the base of imported documents. This attribute is
 *                  optional.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <br/>
 * 
 * This element has as children the elements:
 * <ul>
 *  <li><i>importNCL</i> - element that imports an NCL document. The base must have
 *                         at least one import element.</li>
 * </ul>
