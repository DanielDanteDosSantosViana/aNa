 *  <li><i>id</i> - id of the context element. This attribute is required.</li>
 *  <li><i>refer</i> - reference to a context or body elements. This attribute
 *                     is optional.</li>

 *  <li><i>property</i> - element representing a property. The context can have
 *                        none or several property elements.</li>
 *  <li><i>media</i> - element representing a media object. The context can have
 *                     none or several media elements.</li>
 *  <li><i>context</i> - element representing a composition. The context can have
 *                       none or several context elements.</li>
 *  <li><i>switch</i> - element representing a content control composition. The

 *  <li><i>link</i> - element representing a link among medias or compositions.
 *                    The context can have none or several link elements.</li>
 *  <li><i>meta</i> - elements defining meta data. The context can have none or
